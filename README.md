# ROCK PAPER SCISSORS CLI GAME
this is a game that I made during the time the time when my laptop broke and I tried to code using my ipad mini tablet using the ISH application ruinning I think a version of Alpine linux. This is a simple command-line-interface game that uses python for the main coding language, ASCII-art for the graphics and my idiot brain for the creation.

please take everything you see here with a grain of salt. I know that code looks bad, deal with it I'm the one that coded it and just testing out git and github. Thank you and see you
